  In the past, the DOCTYPE was needed to specify HTML versions.
  As of HTML5, providing `html` is sufficient.
  It is somewhere between a proper HTML tag, and an HTML comment.

    A favicon is the small picture that shows up in the browser's
    tab. Historically, these used a proprietary ".ico" format, and
    you needed to provide many different sizes.
    Happily, you can now provide a single vector graphic in SVG
    format. It will scale to any size, and still look crisp.

        <p class = "mountain">Winter's chill traces the far horizon <br/>
          That thief in the wick gutters the daylight<br/>
          <br/>
          The marsh grasses rise green <br/>
          The berries tip the bucket full <br/>
          The mornings come cool and new <br/>
          as sunrise and sunset separate <br/>
          
          Not autumn, the flaming pyre of summer <br/>
          When the sun flies high, long, lazy circles of blue sky <br/>
          Made by eagles when salmon run the water black<br/>
          <br/>
          Here, the arrogant chariot of the sun will be chained to the mountains <br/>
          To circle low and weak, eaten continuously by the jagged peaks <br/>
          Only the stubble will remain of day <br/>
          <br/>
          Here Apollo, first son of Olympus, fails against Demeter's grief <br/>
          As the shades and the dusk, slender and awkward at first, <br/>
          Become deeper and thicker until darkness clenches its fist <br/>
          <br/>
          Just as the shadows grow longer and linger <br/>
          At day's end <br/>
          The unmistakable chill of December <br/>
          Reaches back into the morning of August <br/>
          Baked off by the afternoon galloping its length <br/>
          <br/>
          Like ants, we scurry <br/>
          Like grasshoppers, sing <br/>
